## 7TH SEM Summer Internship 2025

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Summer Internship 2025!
This repository showcases the journey, learnings, and final project I worked on during my 1-month internship at EDULYT India in the domain of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI & ML).

### 🚀 Introduction 🚀

On 2nd May 2025, I officially began my internship at EDULYT India, a company dedicated to AI-driven solutions and innovative learning opportunities.

The internship lasted for 1 month (02/05/2025 – 02/06/2025), focusing on developing a machine learning system for disease prediction.

The program was designed to provide:

Hands-on training in AI & ML concepts.

Practical exposure to dataset handling, model training, and evaluation.

The opportunity to build a real-world healthcare application.

Focus: Building strong fundamentals in Machine Learning.

Learned basic concepts: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning, classification & regression problems.

Explored common ML algorithms like Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier.

Created a presentation on applications of ML in healthcare to build conceptual clarity.

### 🔹 Week 2 – Data Collection & Preprocessing

Focus: Working with real-world medical datasets.

Gathered symptom-disease datasets (CSV format).

Performed data cleaning: handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Used pandas & numpy for data manipulation.

Encoded categorical symptom data into numerical format suitable for ML models.

### 🔹 Week 3 – Model Building & Evaluation

Focus: Training and comparing machine learning models.

Trained Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes classifiers on the dataset.

Evaluated model performance using Confusion Matrix & Accuracy Score.

Introduced Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for symptom-based prediction with probability scores.

Visualized results using matplotlib & seaborn.

### 🔹 Week 4 – Project Development & Integration

Focus: Creating a functional disease prediction system.

Designed a simple user interface (CLI/Notebook based) for selecting symptoms.

Integrated trained ML models to predict probable diseases.

Displayed results with:

Predicted disease.

Probability distribution.

Basic description, precautions, and remedies for awareness.

Compiled all work into the final project: Personal Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning.



## 📌 Project Overview

Healthcare is rapidly adopting AI and ML for early diagnosis and decision-making.
This project focuses on building a Personal Disease Prediction System that:

Takes symptoms as input.

Predicts possible diseases using machine learning models.

Provides basic health suggestions for awareness.

### ⚙️ Features

✅ Symptom-based disease prediction.

✅ Data preprocessing and model training.

✅ Comparison of multiple classifiers (Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, SVC).

✅ Outputs probable diseases with precautions & remedies.

✅ Simple user interface for input and result display.

### 🏗️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Development Platforms: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Libraries Used:

pandas → Data preprocessing

numpy → Numerical operations

scikit-learn → ML algorithms & evaluation

matplotlib, seaborn → Data visualization

### 📊 Workflow

Data Collection & Preprocessing – Cleaning, encoding, and handling missing values.

Model Training – Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and SVC.

Evaluation – Accuracy and confusion matrix.

Prediction System – Takes symptoms as input → Outputs probable disease.

Suggestions – Provides precautions and remedies for awareness.


### 🚧 Limitations

Limited dataset (doesn’t cover all diseases).

Uses basic ML models (no deep learning).

Predictions are not medically certified.

Works on static data (no real-time monitoring).

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

Integrate advanced ML/DL models (Random Forest, CNNs, etc.).

Deploy as a Flask / FastAPI web app.

Add user login & history tracking.

Improve dataset size & accuracy.
