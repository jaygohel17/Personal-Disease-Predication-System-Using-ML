# Personal-Disease-Predication-System-Using-ML
A machine learning-based application that predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms.

📌 Project Overview

Healthcare is rapidly adopting AI and ML for early diagnosis and decision-making.
This project focuses on building a Personal Disease Prediction System that:

Takes symptoms as input.

Predicts possible diseases using machine learning models.

Provides basic health suggestions for awareness.

⚙️ Features

✅ Symptom-based disease prediction.

✅ Data preprocessing and model training.

✅ Comparison of multiple classifiers (Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, SVC).

✅ Outputs probable diseases with precautions & remedies.

✅ Simple user interface for input and result display.

🏗️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Development Platforms: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Libraries Used:

pandas → Data preprocessing

numpy → Numerical operations

scikit-learn → ML algorithms & evaluation

matplotlib, seaborn → Data visualization

📊 Workflow

Data Collection & Preprocessing – Cleaning, encoding, and handling missing values.

Model Training – Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and SVC.

Evaluation – Accuracy and confusion matrix.

Prediction System – Takes symptoms as input → Outputs probable disease.

Suggestions – Provides precautions and remedies for awareness.

🚧 Limitations

Limited dataset (doesn’t cover all diseases).

Uses basic ML models (no deep learning).

Predictions are not medically certified.

Works on static data (no real-time monitoring).

🚀 Future Enhancements

Integrate advanced ML/DL models (Random Forest, CNNs, etc.).

Deploy as a Flask / FastAPI web app.

Add user login & history tracking.

Improve dataset size & accuracy.
